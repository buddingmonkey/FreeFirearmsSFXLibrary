# Free Firearms SFX Library

This project is a mirror of the [Free Firearms SFX Library KickStarter](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/bjjaszcz/the-firearm-sound-library/description) by _Ben Jaszczak_

_I struggle to find this library when I need it, so this is a mirror of the entire raw tracks_

Here are some excerpts from the original KickStarter and Backer Updates

>The library is going to be released in two parts, the first part will be the entire library with all the raw sounds. The second part will have prepared gunshots ideal for drag and drop applications.

>As a reminder, these [Master SFX] sounds are our unprocessed tracks, meaning most of the gunshots won't come straight off the track and straight into a project without some work put into it. They are however ideal for customizing to your taste with maximum flexibility. 

>The sound library ... includes a master sheet of all the guns/descriptions associated with the generic filenames. That master sheet contains the metadata that is included in each sound file.
